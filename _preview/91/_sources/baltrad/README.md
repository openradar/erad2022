# BALTRAD Tutorial

The BALTRAD approach will be introduced by outlining the ways in which it is commonly deployed, and then the data representation model used by the software will be explained.

Following this introduction, course participants will get the chance to aquaint themselves with the look and feel of the BALTRAD Toolbox by running through a few notebooks that address data representation, quality control, compositing, and other features. Interoperability, how two software packages can pass data to each other, will be demonstrated by chosing between notebooks that do this between BALTRAD and Py-ART or between BALTRAD and wradlib.
