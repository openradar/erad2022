# Getting Started

## 1. Make Sure You Have a Github Account
The first step is to make sure you have a Github Account.

Here is the link if you do have one already:
- [Github account creation link](https://github.com/join)

## 2. Log into Pangeo Binder
Next, sign in and authenticate the Pangeo Binder, which is the platform we will use for the workshop:
- [Pythia Binder Link](http://binder.mypythia.org)

## 3. Launch our Environment
Now that we have our authentication set up, we can access our content!

Use the following link to launch into the binder:
- [Binder Link](http://binder.mypythia.org/v2/gh/openradar/erad2022/main?labpath=notebooks)

If you are having issues with that (ex. it is taking a long time), try using the following link:
```
https://hub.aws-uswest2-binder.pangeo.io/user/{your_github_username}/lab
```
Where you replace `{your_github_username}` with your github username (ex. `mgrover1`)
